# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Q-learning
This project investigates the effectiveness of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning  (RL) algorithm, for predicting stock price movements. It will utilize historical closing  prices to train a Q-learning agent to make "buy" or "sell" decisions, aiming to  maximize profits within a simulated trading environment.
